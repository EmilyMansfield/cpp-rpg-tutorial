# cpp-rpg-tutorial

Source code for my [C++ RPG tutorial](http://www.penguinprogrammer.co.uk/rpg-tutorial-2). The master branch is
(i.e. should be) up to date with the tutorial itself, and the other branches are for development and new additions.
Code is distributed according to the MIT license, so basically do what you want as long as you preserve the copyright
notices and give credit, other than that feel free to fork and use!

This project uses JsonBox for JSON manipulation, namely the file `src/JsonBox.h` and the files in the folder `src/JsonBox/`, which the license file `JsonBox-license.txt` applies exclusively to.
